         *
         *       1. Analytics — These cookies provide statistical information on site usage so the store owner can improve the website over time.
         *       2. Functional — These cookies enable enhanced functionality, such as videos and live chat. If a shopper does not allow these, then some or all of these functions may not work properly.
         *       3. Targeting; Advertising — These cookies allow merchants to create profiles or personalize content to enhance users' shopping experience.
         *
         *
         *     This endpoint only works if the cookie consent feature is enabled. It is assumed the shopper has not consented to anything until a value is explicitly set. The request body must be populated with a complete set of allowed and denied categories.
         *
         *     Once set, consent preferences will be saved as a cookie for guest shoppers. Consent preferences will be persisted to a shopper's account to be used for future sessions once they have logged in. Consent preferences can also be managed using the [Update customer consent](/docs/rest-management/customers/customer-consent#update-customer-consent) endpoint.
